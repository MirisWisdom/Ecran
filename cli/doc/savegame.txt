SAVEGAME.BIN FILE
=================

In HCE, resuming of a single-player mission is done by explicitly
choosing the mission and difficulty that matches the ones saved in the
latest checkpoint.

For an improved user experience, SPV3 automatically handles the resuming
of the campaign behind the scenes, through the use of this file and the
lastprof.txt one.

This document outlines the only two offsets that SPV3 deals with in the
savegame.bin file:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Offset   Description          Value
  -------- -------------------- ---------------------------------------
  0x1E2    Represents the last  Difficulty ID int (see the DIFFICULTIES
           difficulty           section on values)

  0x1E8    Represents the last  Map filename string (library defines it
           played map           as max. 32 chars)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

MISSIONS
--------

The missions are stored as their filenames in the savegame.bin file,
without the MAP extension:

  Mission            Value
  ------------------ ------------------
  SPV3 A10           spv3a10
  SPV3 A30           spv3a30
  SPV3 A50           spv3a50
  SPV3 B30           spv3b30
  SPV3 B30 Evolved   spv3b30\_evolved
  SPV3 B40           spv3b40
  SPV3 C10           spv3c10
  SPV3 C20           spv3c20
  SPV3 C40           spv3c40
  SPV3 D20           spv3d20
  SPV3 D25           spv3d25
  SPV3 D30           spv3d30
  SPV3 D30 Evolved   spv3d30\_evolved
  SPV3 D40           spv3d40
  Lumoria A          lumoria\_a
  Lumoria B          lumoria\_b
  Lumoria C & D      lumoria\_cd

DIFFICULTIES
------------

Difficulties are stored as integers in the savegame.bin file. The
following table lists the integers and the difficulty they represent (in
both HCE and SPV3 contexts):

  Savegame   HCE         SPV3
  ---------- ----------- -----------
  0x0        Easy        Noble
  0x1        Normal      Normal
  0x2        Heroic      Heroic
  0x3        Legendary   Legendary
