DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION
=======================

The SPV3 CLI permits you to import it into your own .NET 4.5.\* project
and rely on its functionality. This documentation outlines the various
ways its library can be used.

PROFILE EDITING
---------------

The default/last-used HCE profile can be automatically detected and
loaded. You can then manipulate its contents and save it. The following
snippet provides a robust example of how to use the API:

    try
    {
        var profile = Profile.Detect();

        profile.Details.Name            = "Red Girl";
        profile.Details.Colour          = Crimson;
        profile.Video.Resolution.Width  = 1920;
        profile.Video.Resolution.Height = 1080;
        profile.Audio.Volume.Master     = 10;
        profile.Audio.Quality           = Normal;

        profile.Save();
    }
    catch (FileNotFoundException e)
    {
        // profile likely does not exist
    }

The tables below outline all of the exposed properties, categorised into three types:

-   options: enum-based properties, e.g. colours, network types

-   integer: properties which you can set an integer value to,
    e.g. volumes, resolutions

-   boolean: properties you can toggle, e.g. video effects, mouse
    vertical axis inversion
