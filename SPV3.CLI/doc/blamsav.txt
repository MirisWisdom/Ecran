BLAM.SAV FILE
=============

The blam.sav file contains the information & configuration for a HCE
profile. Information includes player details, and configuration includes
video/audio/network settings and input configurations (mouse, keyboard,
and controller).

This documentation seeks to specify the properties that are stored in
the binary, their data types & lengths, offsets in the binary, and
checksum information.

INFERENCE
---------

The location of the blam.sav for the relevant profile is implicitly
inferred by detecting the player profile, since the blam.sav itself is
always located in the player's profile directory.

The loader.txt and lastprof.txt documentations go into further detail
about the detection mechanism itself. By detecting the profile name, we
can build the absolute path to the blam.sav we want to (de)serialise.

    Documents\My Games\Halo CE\savegames\<detected profile name>\blam.sav

ANALYSIS
--------

This section analyses the data stored in the blam.sav binary. The
information here permits the loader to load & save player's settings
without the need for storing them separately.

-   size: 8192 bytes (padding)
-   hash: crc-32 (bitwise NOT)

HASH

The blam.sav has a CRC-32 hash appended at the end of it. The value is
actually stored in its complement equivalent (i.e.Â bitwise NOT). This is
done to confirm the integrity of the blam.sav binary; however, it's
possibly a security check to minimise tampering.

  Type     Offset   Length
  -------- -------- --------
  uint32   0x1FFC   4

The hash represents the data between 0x000 and 0x1FFC - the hash itself
is not hashed! Given that the length of the entire binary is 8192, we
can infer the offset of the hash by subtracting 4 from 8192:

      var offset = 8192 - 4 // blam.sav length - hash length

DATA

The table below outlines the list of options in the blam.sav, their
offsets, and data types. The order of the items is determined by their
ascending presence in the blam.sav binary:
