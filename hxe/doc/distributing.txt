SPV3 DISTRIBUTION
=================

This document aims to formally specify how to prepare SPV3.2 for
distribution. HXE allows compiling of the SPV3 data into packages, and
installing these packages.

In essence, you *compile* the SPV3 data to packages, and the users will
*install* the data from these packages to run SPV3.

SUMMARY
-------

1.  Compile the SPV3.2 data into packages using the compile command.
2.  Make an ISO file of these packages, and then distribute it online.
3.  Download the distributed ISO file, which contains the compiled
    packages.
4.  Install the SPV3.2 data by using the install command on the
    packages.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

COMPILING

Run HXE with the compile command:

    .\haloxe.exe compile "C:\Target"

The TARGET should be an empty folder, as the compiler will create the
packages in this folder. These packages will be then shared with other
people through the ISO image. Other files (e.g.Â READMEs) can be added at
your own discretion!

It is assumed that the folder which haloxe.exe is ran from contains the
relevant SPV3.2 data. If that's not the case, either:

-   move the executable to the SPV3.2 folder; or
-   add the path to the SPV3.folder after the target argument.

DISTRIBUTING

Create an ISO of the aforementioned target folder. The software of
choice is completely up to you. ImgBurn is very good. For pedantry's
sake, use the UDF filesystem when creating the ISO. It keeps things nice
and sweet. The release.txt document outlines why ISO should be used.

Once you're done preparing the ISO image, upload them to your preferred
host. Additionally, a torrent file should be created for those whom have
connection problems or simply prefer downloading large files over
BitTorrent.

INSTALLING

Run HXE with the install command, and target arguments:

    .\haloxe.exe install "C:\Target"

This assumes that the packages are located in the same folder as the HXE
executable. Should that not be the case, you can provide the path to the
packages folder after "C:\Target":

    .\haloxe.exe install "C:\Target" "C:\Packages"
