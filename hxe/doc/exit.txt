EXIT CODES
==========

HXE process returns various exit codes depending on what causes it to
exit. The following table outlines the available exit codes, and what
they represent:

  Integer   Description
  --------- ---------------------------
  0         Successful execution
  1         Invalid command provided
  3         Invalid argument provided
  7         Exception has been thrown

These codes can be used by calling applications to infer whether an
operation has succeeded or not, and respond accordingly.

For example, if HXE exits with a code representing an exception being
thrown, then the calling application should display the relevant logs to
the end-user.
