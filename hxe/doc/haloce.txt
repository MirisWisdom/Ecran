HCE EXECUTABLE
==============

HXE is a wrapper around the HCE executable, which means that:

-   HXE ultimately loads the HCE executable after conducting its
    verification, patches, and other routines; and
-   any arguments passed onto HXE that are compatible with HCE will
    result in HCE invoked with the aforementioned arguments;

PATCHING
--------

Large Address Aware can be enabled by applying value 0x2F at offset
0x136 in the HCE 1.0.10 executable.

ARGUMENTS
---------

Refer to the USAGE document for the list of HCE arguments that HXE
supports.

DETECTION
---------

HXE attempts to detect the HCE executable on the filesystem, by
heuristically inferring its path from:

1.  the working directory of the running CLI process; then
2.  the default installation path in Program Files (x86); then
3.  the installation path specified in the relevant registry keys; then
4.  the installation path specified in the SPV3 installation text file.

On each attempt, the loader checks if the executable exists at the
claimed path. If it finds the executable, then it will load it
accordingly.

Registry location:

  Hive                   Key                                          Sub-key
